Pizza is a healthier breakfast choice than cereal, a registered dietitian claims.

“You may be surprised to find out that an average slice of pizza and a bowl of cereal with whole milk contain nearly the same amount of calories,” explained Chelsey Amer, MS, RDN, CDN to The Daily Meal. 

It’s worth bearing in mind, however, that if you were eating pizza for breakfast you’d likely have more than one slice (because who eats just one slice of pizza?) so you would be eating more calories than a bowl of cereal.

However, pizza packs a much larger protein punch, which will keep you full and boost satiety throughout the morning,”

At the end of the day, it comes down to what pizza and what cereal you’re eating.

Some cereals contain large amounts of sugar and have next to no protein or healthy fats to keep you full. 

Amongst the worst offenders on the British supermarket shelves are Frosties (3.7 sugar cubes per 40g serving), Coco Pops (3.5) and Crunchy Nut (3.5).


Can Domino's new 'brain food' pizza really enhance your mind?
At 4g sugar per cube, that’s nearly 15g of sugar per serving, which is half an adult’s recommended daily allowance of free sugars. And many people have more than a 40g serving of cereal too.

So what should you be eating?

“A healthy and well balanced breakfast ideally includes a substantial amount of protein,” Lambert says. “This is something that breakfast cereals may be lacking. We also need to be aware of the added sugar content in cereals as some of them are surprisingly high.
